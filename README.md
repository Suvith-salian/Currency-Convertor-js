# Currency Converter


A simple currency converter web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Convert amounts between different currencies effortlessly!

## Features

- **Real-Time Exchange Rates**: Fetches live exchange rate data from an API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive dropdowns for currency selection.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.


## How It Works

1. **API Integration**:
   - The app fetches exchange rate data from [API Name] (replace with actual API name).
   - The `fetch` function retrieves data asynchronously.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Event listeners capture user interactions (e.g., currency selection).
   - The `updateExchangeRate` function calculates the converted amount.

3. **Customization**:
   - Replace the banner image URL with your own.
   - Customize the UI, add more currencies, or enhance features as needed.
